Fix Things or...Something
Hey there, I’m J.

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
I’m a beginner programmer on an endless quest to **turn coffee into code** — and sometimes bugs into “features” (oops).  

##  What I Do
- Build **small but mighty scripts** 🛠️  
- Share **simple programs** that (hopefully) make life a bit easier  
- Learn in public — so expect commits that are… works‑in‑progress

##  My Mission
Every snippet counts. Whether it’s a one‑liner that saves a click or a tiny tool that spares someone a headache, I believe **code is better when shared**.

##  Current Learning
- Python basics 🐍  
- Git & GitHub workflows 🔄  
- A sprinkle of JavaScript ✨

##  How You Can Help
- Spot something I could improve? Open a pull request!  
- Got an idea for a small project? Let’s build it together.  

##  Fun Fact
I consider `hello world` the first boss fight of programming — and I’ve beaten it more than once.

 **Tip for visitors:** Don’t just star a repo… clone it, break it, fix it, and make it your own!
